Guidelines
----------

Here are some formatting guidelines.
Please follow them so that the entire handbook has the same look and feel.
You should browse through the wiki to get the feel of things; use the Preview button to check that your change look as intended.

* Please use CamelCase links such as UsersGuide, as opposed to links with underscores.

* Start each page with a mixed-case title like this (analogous to \<h1> in HTML):

      Title
      =====

* Divide your page into sections, each starting with a mixed-case header like this (analogous to \<h2>):

      Introduction
      ------------

* Further subdivisions should be mixed-case like this:

      ### How to Get Started

Note that, for all headings, there must be a blank line following the heading.
Trailing white space at the end of a heading is forbidden!

* Link to other wiki pages like this:

      [Text to Display](NameOfPage.md)

* Link to Web pages like this:

      [MINIX 3 documentation](http://www.minix3.org/doc/)

* Program names among normal text should be in italics, like this:

      _mkfs_

* Program names inside example code should be in plain text.
